						Megan is an experienced resource for anyone looking to begin their career search or make a transition. When I worked with Megan while I was still a student, she helped me revamp all of my professional materials including resumes and cover letters as well as provide honest guidance during my job search. I truly appreciated the amount of time and effort she put in to support me, and I have no doubt Megan can provide comprehensive career counseling for anyone.

						As a business student at the University of Miami, I had the pleasure of working alongside Megan as a volunteer at the Toppel Career Center. Megan is the epitome of professionalism when it comes to career counseling. Her eagerness to assist students on a case-by-case basis, with individualized and undivided attention, was remarkable. I'd highly recommend her services to family, friends, and fellow professionals!
